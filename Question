Class Lab #3 – Rent a room 
 
Someone has asked you to create a simple rent form for his property.  
Right now he has only five bedrooms for renting that is priced at $500 each. 
The form requires the client’s first and last name and the number of bedrooms the client wishes to rent.
Each client is limited to the maximum of 5 bedrooms (use NumericUpDown control for this). 
Create a Form that will take the user’s first and last name and the number of bedrooms they wish to rent.
The form should have 3 buttons = Buy, Clear, and Exit.  When the user completes the form and clicks the Buy button, 
the form should display an area of output controls. They include a ‘Thank you’ label that also contains the user’s full name,
a textbox that shows the number of bedrooms rented, and a textbox that displays the total cost.  Format the total cost in currency format.
The Clear button should clear all values and all output controls should not be visible.  
The Exit button closes the application. 
 
 
Other Requirements:
- Use a GroupBox to contain all output controls, which has its Visible property set to False.
- Give the user the option to use the Enter key and Esc key on their key board for renting on clicking Buy button and Clearing the form.
- When the user clicks Buy, set the focus to the Clear button.
- When the user clicks Clear, set the focus to the first name text box ready for another entry.
- Don’t forget to follow a naming convention for your control and variable names.
- Change the Form Title to your name and student number. 
- Include a ‘Title’ label for your firm’s name within the Form and change the font accordingly.
